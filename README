Arctracker, the Archimedes modfile player
-----------------------------------------

This program is designed to play modfiles that have been created using the
Tracker and Desktop Tracker programs that run on the Acorn Archimedes and
compatible range of microcomputers.

Both Tracker and Desktop Tracker are programs that work in the same manner as
the old Ultimate Soundtracker program by Karsten Obarski and all its myriad
clones that run on the Commodore Amiga.  However, both Tracker and Desktop
Tracker have their own file formats and so none of the existing modfile players
available for Linux (or Windows, to the best of my knowledge) will play them.

This program existed for two reasons:

(1) I wanted to be able to play all my old Tracker and Desktop Tracker modfiles
on my Linux machine, and

(2) I wanted to write an advanced tracker editor of my own for Linux and this
seemed like a useful exercise to try my hand at first.

Well, (2) never happened and nowadays Renoise does all that I could ever have
imagined and much more besides. More recently this program has taken on a new
lease of life as a refactoring project.

How to build it
---------------

You need to have GNU automake and autoconf installed. Run the following command:

    autoreconf -vfi

If that succeeds, then run:

    ./configure

You can then build the program with:

    make arctracker

and install it with:

    sudo make install

How to run it
-------------

Currently, the program runs from the command line only.  It is invoked like
this:

    arctracker [options] <modfile>

where <modfile> is the filename of the Tracker or Desktop Tracker modfile to
be played, and [options] can be any or none of the following:

    -h              Print usage information and exit.
    --help
    
    -i              Print information about the module and exit.
    --info

    -l              Continually repeat the modfile until the program is
    --loop          interrupted by ctrl-c.  The default is not to repeat.

    -p              Print the pattern information to stdout as the modfile is
    --pianola       playing in the manner of an old pianola roll.

    -v<n>           Software-scale the volume where n is between 1 and 255. When
    --volume=<n>    playing modfiles with more than 4 channels (Desktop Tracker
                    modfiles can have up to 16) a volume greater than 64 may
                    cause clipping, which sounds distorted. If this happens then
                    use a lower volume.

    -c              Indicate when clipping occurs by printing a bang character
    --clip-warn     to stdout.

    -o<type>        Set the audio output type. Valid types are ALSA and OSS. The
    --output=<type> default is ALSA.
