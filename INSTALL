Requirements
------------

Arctracker has the sole requirement:

	OSS header file: sys/soundcard.h

Arctracker optionally uses the following libraries:

	libartsc (aRts soundserver)

	libasound (ALSA library)

These may well be installed by default.  If not, they will very likely be found
on your distro discs.


Building Arctracker
-------------------

If you want aRts sound output capability, before running "configure" please set
the following environment variable:

	export LDFLAGS=`artsc-config --libs`

This is so the configure script can find the aRts library.  Then, to build
Arctracker simply type:

	./configure
	make

Optionally, to install the arctracker executable to /usr/local/bin*, as root
type:

	make install

After installing, to remove the arctracker executable and all object files,
type:

	make clean

To uninstall arctracker, type:

	make uninstall


*This is the default install location.  To use a different location, run the
configure script with --prefix=<INSTALLDIR> and Arctracker will install in
$(INSTALLDIR)/bin.
